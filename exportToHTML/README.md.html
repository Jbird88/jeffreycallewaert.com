Web Starter Kit uses ESLint with [eslint-config-google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google), which tries to follow the Google JavaScript style guide.                                                                                                </span><span class="s2">|</span><span class="s1">

To enable ES2015 support remove the line `&quot;only&quot;: &quot;gulpfile.babel.js&quot;,` in the [.babelrc](.babelrc) file. ES2015 source code will be automatically transpiled to ES5 for wide browser support.  </span><span class="s2">|</span><span class="s1">

This is made possible by [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/).                                                                                                                                              </span><span class="s2">|</span><span class="s1">

</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Quickstart 
 
[Download](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest) the kit or clone this repository and build on what is included in the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">app</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">directory. 
 
There are two HTML starting points, from which you can choose: 
 
</span><span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">index.html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">- the default starting point, containing Material Design layout. 
</span><span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">basic.html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">- no layout, but still includes our minimal mobile best-practices 
 
Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run WSK. 
Once you have verified that your system can run WSK, check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started. 
 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Web Performance 
 
Web Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box. Our median Web Page Test [scores](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151201_VW_XYC/) for the default template have a [Speed Index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) of ~1100 (1000 is ideal) and a repeat-visit Speed Index of ~550 thanks to Service Worker precaching.  
 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Browser Support 
 
At present, we officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers: 
 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Chrome 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Edge 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Firefox 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Safari 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Opera 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Internet Explorer 9+ 
 
This is not to say that Web Starter Kit cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above. 
 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Troubleshooting 
 
If you find yourself running into issues during installation or running the tools, please check our [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/wiki/Troubleshooting) guide and then open an [issue](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/issues). We would be happy to discuss how they can be solved. 
 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">A Boilerplate-only Option 
 
If you would prefer not to use any of our tooling, delete the following files from the project: </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">package.json</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">gulpfile.babel.js</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">.jshintrc</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">and </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">.travis.yml</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">. You can now safely use the boilerplate with an alternative build-system or no build-system at all if you choose.

</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Inspiration 
 
Web Starter Kit is inspired by [Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/) and Yeoman's [generator-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), having taken input from contributors to both projects during development. Our [FAQs](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/wiki/FAQ) attempt to answer commonly asked questions about the project.
